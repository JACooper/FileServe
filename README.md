File Serve
============

Dead simple server using express for locally hosting, serving, and testing in a browser without needing to upload to an external service. Powered by Express.


Running Locally
---------------

Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org) installed, and that you have an index.html file directly inside the "hosted" folder. You may specify a different name if you wish by editing app.js. Additional files and subfolders within this folder will be served automatically. To start, navigate to the project directory and run

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the server listening for connections. To access files, go to localhost:3000 in the web browser of your choice.
